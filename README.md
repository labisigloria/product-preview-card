## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries


### What I learned
Using media queries to get a responsive view.


### Continued development
Using media query to create responsive images according to different viewports.

### Useful resources

Creating mobile view first before desktop view when creating a responsive page, this is because when you create desktop view first, the mobile view tends to load slower and might not even get to see a responsive page which is frustrating while mobile to desktop view is easier and loads faster.
